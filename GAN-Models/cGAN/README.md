# GAN Models

This repository contains implementations of various **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, trained on different datasets. For each model, we include:

- A brief explanation of the architecture
- Generator and Discriminator loss plots
- A GIF showing generated outputs over training epochs

## Implemented GANs

- [x] Vanilla GAN
- [x] [cDCGAN](./cGAN)
- [ ] in progress....
