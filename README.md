## Overview

ModelCraft is an open-source repository dedicated to machine learning and deep learning architectures, ranging from classical to advanced models. Each model is accompanied by precise mathematical explanations and well-documented Python code implemented in PyTorch. This repository serves as an educational resource for researchers, students, and practitioners interested in understanding and implementing various ML and DL models.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each focusing on a specific category of machine learning or deep learning models. Click the links below to explore each category:

- [**Autoencoders-Models**](./Autoencoders-Models): Implementations of autoencoder-based architectures.
- [**Autoregressive-Models**](./Autoregressive-Models): Code and explanations for autoregressive models.
- [**CNN-Models**](./CNN-Models): Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures and applications.
- [**Diffusion-Models**](./Diffusion-Models): Diffusion-based generative models with detailed documentation.
- [**GAN-Models**](./GAN-Models): Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) implementations.
- [**ML-Supervised-Models**](./ML-Supervised-Models): Supervised machine learning models.
- [**ML-Unsupervised-Models**](./ML-Unsupervised-Models): Unsupervised machine learning models.
- [**NormalizingFlow-Models**](./NormalizingFlow-Models): Normalizing flow models for density estimation and generative tasks.

Each directory contains Jupyter Notebook files with:
- Mathematical formulations of the models.
- Well-commented PyTorch code for implementation.
- Example use cases and visualizations.

### Usage

Each model directory contains notebooks that guide you through:
- The theoretical background and mathematical derivations.
- Step-by-step code implementation in PyTorch.
- Example datasets and training procedures.

To explore a specific model, navigate to its directory using the links above and open the corresponding `.ipynb` file. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the code and experiment with the model.
